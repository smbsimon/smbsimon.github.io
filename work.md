graduate school research:

- My new project explores efforts to collect vital statistics for the 1890 U.S. Census. I presented a working version of this research at the 2025 Midwest Junto for the History of Science and will share an updated version at SHOT 2025.

- I published a paper in the [IEEE Annals of the History of Computing](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10841374) on the young women who operated the Voder, the electrical speech synthesis machine presented by AT&T/Bell Labs at the 1939 New York World's Fair. I shared part of this research in September 2023 at SIGCIS, then presented an updated version in March 2024 at the Midwest Junto for the History of Science.

- I'm working on a paper that historicizes the labor debates surrounding electronic death registration. This project grew out of a workshop hosted by the Epidemy Lab on data and disease in historical prospective. I presented part of my research at ICOHTEC-SHOT in July 2024.

- At the May 2023 International Conference on Computer Ethics: Philosophical Enquiry, I presented a paper on medical scribes and their role in salvaging the utility of electronic health records. I also presented this research in October 2023 at the Leibniz AILab's Trustworthy AI Lab.



a random sampling of pre-grad school journalism & public writing:

- For The COVID Tracking Project, I published multiple pieces on the [challenges](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/05/pandemic-data-america-messy/618987/) and [quirks](https://covidtracking.com/analysis-updates/silent-data-mismatches-are-compromising-key-covid-19-indicators) of [COVID-19 data](https://covidtracking.com/analysis-updates/three-covid-19-data-problems). 

- At Spotlight PA, I covered COVID-19 extensively, culminating in an investigation into [Pennsylvania's system of electronic death registration](https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/09/pa-coronavirus-deaths-reporting-edrs/). A few other pieces stand out: I wrote about [a debate coroners had](https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/04/pennsylvania-coronavirus-coroners-testing-communication-health-department/) with state health officials, a major health system that made [dishonest claims](https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/07/coronavirus-less-severe-strain-pennsylvania-upmc-claim/) about the severity of the virus, and a [major university](https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/08/penn-state-coronavirus-covid-19-students-liability-waivers-fall-semester/) that forced students to assume all risk of COVID-19. Prior to the pandemic, I also reported on Pennsylvania's new system of [automated guardianship oversight](https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/03/pennsylvania-supreme-court-guardianship-seniors/).

- The majority of my work at the New York Times was behind the scenes, contributing to internal software for research and reporting. Occasionally, I worked on public-facing projects, like this story on [state-level abortion restrictions](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/07/20/us/mississippi-abortion-restrictions.html). In 2018, I wrote about [how and why I convinced the Styles desk](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/12/insider/miss-america-data-software.html) to send me to Atlantic City to help cover the ðŸ‘‘ Miss America ðŸ‘‘ pageant. I also co-edited [Times Open](https://archive.nytimes.com/open.blogs.nytimes.com/), a blog about making digital products at the New York Times.

- I wrote about [my decision to leave journalism](https://source.opennews.org/articles/exit-interviews-sara-simon/) for Source, a blog from OpenNews. Poynter also once interviewed me about [my beloved little poop bot](https://www.poynter.org/tech-tools/2016/you-can-steal-sara-simons-sewage-bot-and-everything-else-she-makes/), which I built for Vermont Public Radio. 

- For Increment, I wrote [a poem about code](https://increment.com/programming-languages/code-poetry/).
