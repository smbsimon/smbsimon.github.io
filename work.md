graduate school research:

- Currently, I'm working on a paper that historicizes the labor demands behind Electronic Death Registration Systems for the Epidemy Lab's upcoming "Data & Disease in Historical Perspective" workshop.

- At the May 2023 International Conference on Computer Ethics: Philosophical Enquiry, I presented [a paper on medical scribes](https://journals.library.iit.edu/index.php/CEPE2023/article/view/265) and their role in salvaging the utility of electronic health records. 

- For an independent study I completed on Data & Power, my final project was to design my own [Data & Power syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qqtiCt3JfSFy8n0hBx4CHA_2nEgzWptyOEbTAVisa8w/edit?usp=sharing).

- For Illinois Tech's Socially Responsible Modeling, Computation, and Design initiative, I wrote about [COVID-19 data in historical perspective](https://soremo.library.iit.edu/index.php/Soremo/article/view/212), using Chicago's 1995 heat wave as a case study. 


a random sampling of pre grad school journalism & public writing:

- For The COVID Tracking Project at the Atlantic, I published multiple pieces on the [challenges](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/05/pandemic-data-america-messy/618987/) and [quirks](https://covidtracking.com/analysis-updates/silent-data-mismatches-are-compromising-key-covid-19-indicators) of [COVID-19 data](https://covidtracking.com/analysis-updates/three-covid-19-data-problems). 

- For Spotlight PA at the Philadelphia Inquirer, I covered COVID-19 extensively. A few pieces stand out: I wrote about [a debate coroners had](https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/04/pennsylvania-coronavirus-coroners-testing-communication-health-department/) with state health officials, a major health system that made [dishonest claims](https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/07/coronavirus-less-severe-strain-pennsylvania-upmc-claim/) about the severity of the virus, and a [major university](https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/08/penn-state-coronavirus-covid-19-students-liability-waivers-fall-semester/) that forced students to assume all risk of COVID-19. (Prior to the pandemic, I also reported on Pennsylvania's new system of [automated guardianship oversight](https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/03/pennsylvania-supreme-court-guardianship-seniors/).)

- The majority of my work at the New York Times was behind the scenes, contributing to internal software for research and reporting. Occasionally, I worked on public-facing projects, like this story on [state-level abortion restrictions](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/07/20/us/mississippi-abortion-restrictions.html). In 2018, I wrote about [how and why I convinced the Styles desk](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/12/insider/miss-america-data-software.html) to send me to Atlantic City to help cover the ðŸ‘‘ Miss America ðŸ‘‘ pageant. I also co-edited [Times Open](https://archive.nytimes.com/open.blogs.nytimes.com/), a blog about making digital products at the New York Times.

- I wrote about [my decision to leave journalism](https://source.opennews.org/articles/exit-interviews-sara-simon/) for Source, a blog from OpenNews. Poynter also once interviewed me about [my beloved little poop bot](https://www.poynter.org/tech-tools/2016/you-can-steal-sara-simons-sewage-bot-and-everything-else-she-makes/), which I built for Vermont Public Radio. 

- For Increment, I wrote [a poem about code](https://increment.com/programming-languages/code-poetry/). I also used to speak at tech conferences regularly. A 2015 talk on my experiences [learning Ruby on Rails vs. Mandarin Chinese](https://medium.com/@sarambsimon/learning-fluency-672988a7ae52) is a favorite.
