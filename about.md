I'm a second-year PhD student in the humanities department at Illinois Tech. Prior to graduate school, I worked as a communications associate at Software for Good, a web developer at Vermont Public Radio, a software engineer at The New York Times, and an investigative data reporter at Spotlight PA. 

In September 2020, I left traditional journalism to join The COVID Tracking Project, where I worked to compile, vet, and document state-level COVID-19 data. My research now in grad school examines the history of U.S. death data infrastructure.

I graduated with honors in English from Wellesley College and received a certificate in full-stack software development from the Turing School.
