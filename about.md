In September 2024, I'll be starting a Ph.D. in history at Northwestern, where I'll also be part of the graduate science studies cluster. My research is in the history of technology, and I'm particularly interested in themes of data labor and hidden infrastructure. I have an M.S. from Illinois Tech, a B.A. from Wellesley College, and a certificate in full-stack software development from the Turing School of Software and Design.

Between undergrad and graduate school, I spent six years in newsroom engineering and data journalism roles. I worked at Vermont Public Radio, The New York Times, and Spotlight PA before deciding, in 2020, to leave traditional journalism to join data quality efforts at The COVID Tracking Project.

I live in Chicago with my husband, [Mike Tigas](https://mike.tig.as/), and our tuxedo cat, Clooney. My pronouns are she/her.
