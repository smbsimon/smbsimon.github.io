My professional interests sit somewhere between technology and society.

I spent the first chapter of my career in journalism. I worked as a web developer at Vermont Public Radio and software engineer at The New York Times, then as an investigative data reporter for Spotlight PA.

These days, I'm spending my time with The COVID Tracking Project, helping to compile and vet state-level COVID-19 data. It's been important to me to understand where exactly these numbers are coming from, what they mean & what they don't.

My pronouns are she/her. I graduated with honors in English from Wellesley College and received a certificate in full-stack software development from the Turing School.
