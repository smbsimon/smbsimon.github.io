I'm currently a master's student in the humanities department at Illinois Tech. In fall 2024, I'll be starting a Ph.D. in history at Northwestern, where I'll also be part of the graduate science studies cluster. My research is in the history of technology, and I'm particularly interested in themes of data labor and hidden infrastructure. 

Prior to graduate school, I worked as an investigative data reporter at Spotlight PA, a software engineer at The New York Times, and a web developer at Vermont Public Radio. In 2020, I decided to leave traditional journalism to join data quality efforts at The COVID Tracking Project.

I graduated with honors in English from Wellesley College in 2013, then received a certificate in full-stack software development from the Turing School in 2015.

I live in Chicago with my husband, [Mike Tigas](https://mike.tig.as/), and our tuxedo cat, Clooney. My pronouns are she/her.
