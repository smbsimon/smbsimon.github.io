I'm a first-year PhD student at Illinois Tech, studying the history of technology. Prior to graduate school, I worked as a web developer at Vermont Public Radio, software engineer at The New York Times, and investigative data reporter at Spotlight PA. 

In September 2020, I left traditional journalism to join The COVID Tracking Project, where I worked to compile, vet, and document state-level COVID-19 data. Studying the history of fragmented data pipelines in an attempt to make sense of their outputs was what compelled me to head back to school.

I graduated with honors in English from Wellesley College and received a certificate in full-stack software development from the Turing School.

My pronouns are she/her.
