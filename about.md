I'm a graduate student in the humanities department at Illinois Tech, where my research explores historical intersections between technology, data, public health, labor, and gender. 

At Illinois Tech, I currently work as a teaching assistant for an undergraduate humanities class on writing about data and science. I've also worked as a research assistant for Dr. Mar Hicks on topics related to the history of technology, labor, gender, and sexuality, as well as for Dr. Carly Kocurek on an NSF-funded project about [the history of the Games for Girls movement](https://www.iit.edu/news/looking-closer-games-girls-movement). Additionally, I was a fellow with the university's Socially Responsible Modeling, Computation, and Design initiative.

Prior to graduate school, I worked as an investigative data reporter at Spotlight PA, software engineer at The New York Times, and web developer at Vermont Public Radio. In 2020, I decided to leave traditional journalism to join data quality efforts at The COVID Tracking Project, where I worked to compile, vet, and describe state-level COVID-19 data.

I graduated with honors in English from Wellesley College and received a certificate in full-stack software development from the Turing School. Over the years, I've spoken at many technology and journalism conferences and have been invited regularly to speak with classes of college students about career paths into tech + data + journalism. 

I live in Chicago with my husband, [Mike Tigas](https://mike.tig.as/), and our tuxedo cat, Clooney.
