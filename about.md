In September 2024, I'll be starting a Ph.D. in history at Northwestern University, where I'll also be part of the graduate science studies cluster. My research is in the history of technology, and I'm especially interested in themes of data labor and hidden infrastructure. 

Prior to graduate school, I spent six years in newsroom engineering and data journalism roles. I worked as a web developer at Vermont Public Radio, a software engineer in the newsroom of the New York Times, and as an investigative data reporter with Spotlight PA. In 2020, I decided to leave traditional journalism to join data quality efforts at The COVID Tracking Project before returning to academia. 

I have a B.A. in English from Wellesley College (2013), a certificate in full-stack software development from the Turing School of Software and Design (2015), and an M.S. in Technology & Humanities from the Illinois Institute of Technology (2024).

I live in Chicago with my husband, [Mike Tigas](https://mike.tig.as/), and our tuxedo cat, Clooney. My pronouns are she/her.
