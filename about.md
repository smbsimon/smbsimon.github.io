I'm a graduate student in the humanities department at Illinois Tech, where my research explores historical intersections between technology, data, public health, labor, and gender. 

Prior to graduate school, I worked as an investigative data reporter at Spotlight PA, software engineer at The New York Times, and web developer at Vermont Public Radio. In 2020, I decided to leave traditional journalism to join data quality efforts at The COVID Tracking Project, where I worked to compile, vet, and describe state-level COVID-19 data.

I graduated with honors in English from Wellesley College and received a certificate in full-stack software development from the Turing School. Over the years, I've spoken at many technology and journalism conferences and have been invited regularly to speak with classes of college students about career paths into tech + data + journalism. 

I live in Chicago with my husband, [Mike Tigas](https://mike.tig.as/), and our tuxedo cat, Clooney. 

My pronouns are she/her.
