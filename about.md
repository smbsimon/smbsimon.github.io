My professional interests sit somewhere between technology and society.

I spent the first chapter of my career in journalism. I worked as a web developer at Vermont Public Radio and software engineer at The New York Times, then as an investigative data reporter for Spotlight PA.

Most recently, I was on staff with The COVID Tracking Project, where I helped to compile and vet state-level COVID-19 data.

I graduated with honors in English from Wellesley College and received a certificate in full-stack software development from the Turing School. In fall 2021, I'll be starting a PhD at Illinois Tech, studying the history of technology.

My pronouns are she/her.
