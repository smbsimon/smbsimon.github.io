I'm a graduate student in the humanities department at the Illinois Institute of Technology, where my research explores historical intersections between technology, data, public health, labor, and gender. 

Prior to graduate school, I worked as an investigative data reporter at Spotlight PA, a software engineer at The New York Times, and a web developer at Vermont Public Radio. In 2020, I decided to leave traditional journalism to join data quality efforts at The COVID Tracking Project, where I worked to compile, vet, and describe state-level COVID-19 data.

I graduated with honors in English from Wellesley College in 2013, then received a certificate in full-stack software development from the Turing School in 2015.

I live in Chicago with my husband, [Mike Tigas](https://mike.tig.as/), and our tuxedo cat, Clooney. My pronouns are she/her.
