I'm a second-year PhD student in the humanities department at Illinois Tech, where my research interests include critical algorithm studies, critical data studies, and the history of technology. Currently, I work as a research assistant for Dr. Mar Hicks on a variety of topics related to the history of technology, gender, and labor. 

At Illinois Tech, I've also worked as a research assistant for Dr. Carly Kocurek on an NSF-funded project about the history of the Games for Girls movement. Additionally, in fall 2021, I was a fellow with the university's Socially Responsible Modeling, Computation, and Design initiative.

Prior to graduate school, I worked as a communications associate at Software for Good, web developer at Vermont Public Radio, software engineer at The New York Times, and investigative data reporter at Spotlight PA. In September 2020, [I decided to leave traditional journalism](https://source.opennews.org/articles/exit-interviews-sara-simon/) to join the data quality team at The COVID Tracking Project, where I worked to compile, vet, and document state-level COVID-19 data.

I graduated with honors in English from Wellesley College and received a certificate in full-stack software development from the Turing School. Over the years, I've spoken at dozens of technology and journalism conferences and have been invited regularly to speak to classes of college students about career paths into tech + data journalism.
