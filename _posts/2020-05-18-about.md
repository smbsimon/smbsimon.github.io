I'm a PhD student in the humanities department at Illinois Tech. Prior to graduate school, I worked as a communications associate at a [software consultancy](https://softwareforgood.com/), web developer at Vermont Public Radio, software engineer at The New York Times, and investigative data reporter at Spotlight PA. 

In September 2020, I left traditional journalism to join The COVID Tracking Project, where I worked to compile, vet, and document state-level COVID-19 data. My research now in grad school examines the history of the fragility of U.S. data pipelines.

I graduated with honors in English from Wellesley College and received a certificate in full-stack software development from the Turing School.

My pronouns are she/her.
