I'm a first-year PhD student at Illinois Tech, studying the history of technology.

Prior to graduate school, I worked as a web developer at Vermont Public Radio and software engineer at The New York Times, then as an investigative data reporter for Spotlight PA. During the last quarter of 2020 and first two of 2021, I was a volunteer, then on staff, with The COVID Tracking Project, where I helped to compile and vet state-level COVID-19 data.

I graduated with honors in English from Wellesley College and received a certificate in full-stack software development from the Turing School.
